                <p>Dali City, located in western Yunnan Province, China, was the capital of the ancient Nanzhao
                    Kingdom and Dali Kingdom. Dali City is inhabited by a concentration of minority peoples,
                    mainly the Bai. At the heart of this scenic area is Dali Old Town, north of which stand the Three
                    Pagodas of the Chongsheng Temple, a legacy of the Nanzhao and Dali Kingdoms. On the periphery
                    of simple and elegant Dali are the majestic Cang Mountain and charming Erhai Lake.

                <p>Throughout the seasons of the year, Kunming is like springtime, leading it to be called "Spring
                    City". For many people who come to Yunnan on holiday, it is their first stop. The nearby Dianchi
                    Lake has 250 kilometers of coastline, all with brilliant natural scenery. There are super-large
                    fresh flower markets. There are also cultural attractions, such as Yunnan University, Yunnan
                    Military Academy, and the former site of Southwest United University. Trying out Kunming snacks,
                    local Yunnan cuisine and wild mushroom hotpot is a must. Every year when winter comes, flocks of
                    black-headed gulls fly here from Siberia; Cuihu Park and Dianchi Lake are good places for
                    bird-watching and bird feeding. The area surrounding Kunming is also very exciting. Dongchuan Red
                    Land is colorful like an oil painting. The Stone Forest has all kinds of different and interestingly
                    shaped rocks. Guandu Ancient Town is also a good place to visit.

                <p>Listed as a World Heritage Site, Lijiang Old Town was a chaotic and bustling transit and transfer
                    point on both the famous Silk Road and the Tea Horse Road. The ancient city never had city walls.
                    Lying between the river and the mountains, the landscape is magnificent. Inside the old town, the
                    roads are paved with slick cobblestones. The quaint buildings, small arched bridges and beautiful
                    plateau scenery have attracted the interest of countless visitors. The relaxed pace of life and
                    unique Nakhi culture are also part of the Lijiang's charm. The area surrounding the old town also
                    has many beautiful natural landscapes such as the magnificent Yulongxue (Jade Dragon Snow) Mountain
                    and the idyllic Lashihai Lake. If you like ancient towns, Shuhe or Baisha Old Towns are sure to

                <p>Xishuangbanna is a famous tourism location in Yunnan, known for its magical rainforest landscape and
                    unique ethnic customs. Xishuangbanna is the home of the Dai people. Because it is close to Buddhist
                    countries like Thailand and Myanmar, the Dai people are generally devoted Buddhist believers.
                    Xishuangbanna is dotted with Southeast Asian Buddhist temples and pagodas. It is also a kingdom for
                    natural life, with a wide variety of animal and plant resources, many of which are rare and
                    endangered species. Every year in April, the Dai celebrate their version of Songkran (or Water
                    Splashing Festival). This is an experience unlike any other and attracts visitors from all over the
                    world to join in and experience the fun.
